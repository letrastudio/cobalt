# cobalt

Cobalt is an all-purpose SCSS framework with as few styles as possible.

Inspired by default browser stylesheets, it's meant to make almost any HTML look readable, using "semantic" styles. It sets up a strong typographic foundation and a versatile spacing system based on margin collapsing, in addition to handling tables, code blocks, and form elements in a modern way.

It's highly customizable — almost everything is connected to sass variables — so it can quickly adapt to any kind of project. It can grow and transition from HTML prototyping all the way to production stylesheets for complex sites.

Some `normalize.css`-style cross-browser normalization is applied, but kept to a minimum. It's okay for browsers to do their own thing sometimes.

A few extra scss partials are included with more opinionated stuff. They provide simple solutions to common web design patterns, showing how cobalt's variables and mixins can be used.
